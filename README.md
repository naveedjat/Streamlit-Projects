# Project Title:  Weather Forecast Web Application

## Introduction:

```This project is a web-based weather application developed using Streamlit and a Weather API. It allows users to check real-time weather information for any city around the world. The app provides an easy-to-use interface that displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and more in a visually appealing format.```

## Objective:

The main objective of this project is to:

* Provide real-time weather updates for any location.

* Demonstrate integration of external APIs into a Python web app.

* Build an interactive and user-friendly weather dashboard using Streamlit.

## Problem Statement:

```In our daily lives, accurate and quick access to weather data is essential for travel, work, and outdoor activities. Many users want a simple web interface where they can instantly check current weather conditions without navigating complex websites or apps.```

## Proposed Solution:

The Weather App fetches weather data from a reliable public API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) using the city name provided by the user. Streamlit displays the data in a clean and responsive layout. Users can also view additional details like:
Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit

## Technologies Used:

* Programming Language: Python

* Framework: Streamlit

* API: OpenWeatherMap (or any other weather API)

* Libraries: requests, streamlit, json 

## Workflow / Methodology:

* User inputs the city name in the Streamlit interface.

* The app sends a request to the weather API using the requests library.

* The API responds with current weather data in JSON format.

* The app extracts key data and displays it using Streamlit components.

## Conclusion:

The Weather App provides users with instant and accurate weather updates using real-time API data. It demonstrates how APIs can be effectively integrated with Streamlit to create interactive, data-driven web applications.
